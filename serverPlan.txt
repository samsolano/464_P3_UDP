- window structure
- setup socket
- poll to wait for connection
- after connection, go to main fsm function for connection
- first state is establishment
- second state is use
- third is teardown and clean up
- change hardcoded values for sent values: window size, file name, etc.







- Window Structure
    - create space for it
    - add packet to it





- current starts at 0, and it goes the value that is next to send



PDU Header:

 4 bytes  2 bytes    1 byte

establish packet: 

    4 bytes            2 bytes (1-1400)     1 bytes         ??bytes
|   window-size    |    buffer size    |   filename len  |   filename   |




FSM

windowopen -> windowopen: keep sending
windowopen -> windowopen_RR: update window
windowclosed -> srej: resend srej'd packet
windowclosed-> rr: update window
window-> teardown
